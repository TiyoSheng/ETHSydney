            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
              At ETHSydney's community hackathon, our goal is to promote collaboration and learning within the community. We greatly value the participation of every member and aim to ensure that all attendees have an enjoyable and rewarding experience. Accordingly, all participants are expected to demonstrate respect and courtesy toward others throughout the event. To clarify our expectations, all attendees and speakers are required to adhere to the following Code of Conduct, which will be enforced by the organizers.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Code</h3>
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
              Harassment includes, but is not limited to, offensive verbal comments, hacks, or online activities related to gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental abilities, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, physical appearance, race, religion, use of inappropriate images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome attention. Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to do so may result in removal from the event.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
              This anti-harassment policy applies to everyone involved in the event, including partners, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, ETHSydney staff, and all attendees. Specifically, participants should avoid using inappropriate images, activities, or other materials in their hacks or during the event.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
              Please be mindful of the language you use. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary comments and hacks can be offensive to those around you.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
              If a participant engages in behavior that violates this Code of Conduct, the organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including issuing a warning or expelling the offender from the event.
            </p>
            <p class="text-base md:text-lg">
              If you feel uncomfortable or believe there may be a potential violation of the Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to an event organizer or email us at <a href="mailto:hi@ethsydney.net" class="text-[#ABF8FF] hover:underline">hi@ethsydney.net</a>.
